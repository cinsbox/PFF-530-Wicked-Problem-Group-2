### Audience

#### The audience is composed of 24 elementary school teachers, ranging from grades TK - 6th, including 3 SPED teachers and one PE teacher. A social emotional learning(SEL) curriculum and a restorative practices policy were both first introduced in the 2019 - 2020 school year. Teachers are expected to teach a minimum of one SEL lesson per week and provide ongoing SEL support to students as often as needed. Teachers have received training on SEL strategies such as restorative circles and provided resources that they are expected to implement in their classrooms.
