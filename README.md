# **PFF 530 Group 2 Wicked Problem**

### Summary

#### Our presentation of a wicked problem in education, ‘A Foster Child’s Path to Success in School’ took place on July 29, 2020 and was delivered to The Journey School’s 27 teachers and administrators. The Journey School is a TK-6 elementary school in Moreno Valley, CA. The presentation covered the current literature, research, flow maps, statistics and data on foster youth in California for the purposes of teacher collaboration and the identification of an action plan. Following our presentation, our conclusion reinforced the need for a social and emotional learning curriculum including restorative justice practices.

### Purpose

#### Helping foster youth succeed at school is a wicked problem.  Sadly the current state of school success for foster youth is very low.  According to EdSource, high school graduation rates for foster youth are currently at 59%, compared to 83% for all high school students.  For those students who do make it to college, only 49.6% are still there after the first two semesters.  That leaves 50.4% of foster youth dropping out of higher education at some point within their first two semesters.  Our Wicked Problem Group took on this issue to explore and better understand the challenges that limit school success for foster youth as well as the supports that allow some foster youth to make it through high school and then go on to succeed in college.  We then had an opportunity to present this information to teachers at the Journcy School. The purpose of this presentation was to inform the teachers about the challenges foster youth face as they work to succeed in school.  We wanted these teachers to know they could be a part of making a difference for these youth and moving them to a better place in the future.  We also had the purpose of linking the needs of foster youth to the school wide social-emotional learning (SEL) program, and giving them an opportunity to see the impact this SEL program could have on all students with the different life challenges they face.  

### Audience

#### The audience is composed of 24 elementary school teachers, ranging from grades TK - 6th, including 3 SPED teachers and one PE teacher. A SEL curriculum and a restorative practices policy were both first introduced in the 2019 - 2020 school year. Teachers are expected to teach a minimum of one SEL lesson per week and provide ongoing SEL support to students as often as needed. Teachers have received training on SEL strategies such as restorative circles and provided resources that they are expected to implement in their classrooms.
